# The CSES Server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.

## Development server

Run `npm run start:watch` in one terminal and `npm run build:watch` for a dev server, the start command starts the server stored under /server, which provides the controllers and database access routines, and the build command compiles the typescript files stored under /src into the dist directory, which provides the views. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Currently, given the scope of this project, there are no testing guidelines, however, showing some in the case of complex functionality is helpful.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
